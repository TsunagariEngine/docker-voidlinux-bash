Simple Docker image that provides voidlinux/voidlinux:latest but with bash
installed.

This allows CircleCI to use Void Linux because they want bash installed before
running any build script.

A pre-built image is [available on Docker
Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/pmerrill/voidlinux-bash),
although if this image is old, you may desire to clone this repo and build it
yourself.
